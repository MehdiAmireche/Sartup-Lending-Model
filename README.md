# Sartup Lending Model
This project showcases a probabilistic loan pricing and risk-adjusted return model designed to evaluate startup lending portfolios. Built entirely in Python, the model integrates credit risk modeling, expected IRR computation, and scenario-based stress testing to simulate lending performance under varying default environments. It captures the dynamics of default probability decay, loan recovery, and interest rate sensitivity across multiple loan maturities (5, 10, and 20 years). The model computes expected internal rates of return (IRR) across hundreds of parameter combinations, revealing how profitability responds to changes in credit quality and interest rate policy. Beyond deterministic projections, it embeds stochastic elements—such as variable default probabilities and recovery scenarios—to reflect real-world lending uncertainty. This analytical tool demonstrates the use of Python for structured financial modeling, credit risk analysis, and decision optimization, serving as a practical framework for lenders and investors assessing startup credit portfolios.
